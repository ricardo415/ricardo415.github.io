        <p class="lead">Ricardo is a no bones, "what you see is what you get" individual. He is one of those quiet but powerful individuals who silently has as a huge impact on a workplace.He serviced my client with an integrity that made them not only beholden to his work but to the whole organization.When the opportunity arises again I look forward to working with him and I recommend you should as well.-George Castillo</p>

        <p class="lead">Ricardo is an absolute dream to work with. He is timely in all of his responses and can be reached at any hour of the day. Ricardo possesses a wealth of knowledge related to finding the right talent for the right roles. One of Ricardo's many talents is to balance the demands of an unpredictable market with the requirements set forth from the client. Ricardo is an all-around great contributor and would recommend him to join any burgeoning organization-David Cuberos</p>

        <p class="lead">I've met many professionals in my career, but none as keen and versatile as Ricardo. He was an integral part of Aptozen. He was able to juggle many hats while at this start-up company. Although his title was Talent Acquisition Manager, he was also acting as the UX designer alongside the product team. He was the leader of his team and was relied upon heavily by the Director of People Operations and the go-to person for the Sales team. Any project that was given to Ricardo, he was always the first one in the office and the last one out of his team to make sure it was taken care of. He was in line to become Senior Recruiter and Head lead of the Talent acquisition team before Aptozen unexpectedly closed its Doors. Anyone who has the pleasure of working with Ricardo will no doubt have an individual who leads by example and has tremendous leadership qualities. Having Ricardo as part of your team will be a tremendous asset to any company.-Tania Castillo</p>

        <p class="lead">I had the wonderful pleasure of having Ricardo on my team at AptoZen. Ricardo is a top notch technical recruiter - no search was too difficult for him! Ricardo sourced, screened, and placed amazing candidates. He truly understands the needs of companies and the technical talent that is required to build great teams and great products. Building relationships and understanding the market place are all skills that Ricardo carries with him. He can multi-task, work on multiple roles and projects at the same time, and expand his professional development in new areas with ease. Not only did Ricardo fill roles in record time, he also took on additional UX design responsibilities, leveraging his creative talents and adding value to the Product Marketing team's efforts. Ricardo is also a very FUN person to have around - he has a passionate spirit and is a very kind and caring individual. 
I'd welcome the opportunity to work with Ricardo again, and any company looking to build teams and products would be so very lucky to have Ricardo on the team!-Sherry Carpenter</p>

        <p class="lead">Ricardo's passion for design follows him in all aspects of life. I have been lucky to work with him for a year collaborating on multiple design projects for mobile and web based platforms. As a product manager, I was particularly impressed in his ability to work cross functionally to find what works best for our employees and clients. He always keeps the end user in mind and this is clearly demonstrated in his work. He is always able to put a smile on the faces of his colleagues while doing a great job. I am happy to be able to continue to work and collaborate with him in the future to build great products with quality design.-Amy Hubbard</p>
